    "text": "Introduction\nThe objective of this proposal is to explore the complex dynamics between childcare costs, unemployment rates, and poverty levels across various locations in the United States. By utilizing two main datasets—the National Database of Childcare Prices (NDCP) and a comprehensive Counties Dataset—we aim to uncover patterns and correlations that can inform us about any hidden relationship between these variables. The NDCP dataset, spanning from 2008 to 2018, offers an unparalleled look at childcare prices across the county level, categorized by provider type and age groups, while the Counties Dataset provides essential geographical and demographic insights."

Childcare Costs Dataset\n\nSource: The National Database of Childcare Prices (NDCP)\nDescription: This dataset is the most comprehensive federal source of childcare prices at the county level. It provides childcare price data by childcare provider type, age of children, and county characteristics. The data spans from 2008 to 2018, offering estimates of childcare prices at the county level for different age groups and care settings, including home-based and center-based providers.\n\n\n\n2. Counties Dataset\n\nDescription: This dataset contains geographical information for each county, and it will be used for spatial plotting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nunr_16\nUnemployment rate of the population aged 16 years old or older.\n\n\nfunr_16\nUnemployment rate of the female population aged 16 years old or older.\n\n\nmunr_16\nUnemployment rate of the male population aged 16 years old or older.\n\n\npr_f\nPoverty rate for families.\n\n\npr_p\nPoverty rate for individuals.\n\n\nmc_infant\nAggregated weekly, full-time median price charged for Center-based Care for infants (i.e. aged 0 through 23 months).\n\n\nmc_toddler\nAggregated weekly, full-time median price charged for Center-based Care for toddlers (i.e. aged 24 through 35 months).\n\n\nmc_preschool\nAggregated weekly, full-time median price charged for Center-based Care for preschoolers (i.e. aged 36 through 54 months).\n\n\nmfcc_infant\nAggregated weekly, full-time median price charged for Family Childcare for infants (i.e. aged 0 through 23 months).\n\n\nmfcc_toddler\nAggregated weekly, full-time median price charged for Family Childcare for toddlers (i.e. aged 24 through 35 months).\n\n\nmfcc_preschool\nAggregated weekly, full-time median price charged for Family Childcare for preschoolers (i.e. aged 36 through 54 months).\n\n\n\n\n\nReason for Choosing this Dataset\nThe reason for choosing this dataset is rooted in its potential to offer comprehensive insights into the intersection of childcare prices, unemployment rates, and poverty levels across different locations in the United States. The dataset covers a significant timeframe (2008 to 2018) and includes variables such as unemployment rates for different demographics, poverty rates for families and individuals, and median prices for center-based and family childcare across various age groups."

    "text": "Analysis Plan\n\nIntroduction\nThis section outlines our methodology for investigating the relationships between unemployment rates, poverty levels, and childcare costs across the United States. By examining these variables, we aim to identify patterns that could have significant implications for social policy and economic support systems.\n\n\nApproach\nTo systematically address our research questions, we will employ spatial analysis techniques alongside statistical correlation assessments. The analysis will be conducted in two main parts, corresponding to our central questions:\n\n\nFor Question 1\n\nWe will focus on the distribution of unemployment rates across genders and its relationship with poverty. The methodology includes creating spatial maps to visualize mean unemployment rates (overall, and by gender) across the US. We will then calculate the correlation between the overall unemployment rate and individual poverty levels at the county level, producing spatial maps to display these correlations.\nFor “Which locations have lower unemployment rates?”, we will use the “unr_16” variable and the county IDs to plot the spatial map of the overall unemployment rate. We first average the mentioned variable over time, and then the averaged unemployment rate will be used to plot the spatial map.\nFor the second part, specifically gender-related, the “munr_16” and “funr_16” variables, as well as county location IDs, will be used to plot the unemployment rates for men and women, respectively. We first average the mentioned variables over time, and then the averaged unemployment rates will be used to plot the spatial map.\nTo quantify the relationship between the unemployment rate and poverty, the correlation between individual poverty, “pr_p”, and overall unemployment, “unr_16”, will be calculated for each county, and a spatial map will be plotted.\n\n\n\nFor Question 2\n\nThe emphasis will be on understanding the dynamics between family poverty rates and the financial burden of childcare. This part involves generating spatial maps to illustrate the average rate of family poverty across the US. Subsequently, we will assess the correlation between family poverty rates and the cumulative childcare costs (encompassing both Family Childcare and Center-based Care) for all age groups at the county level, with spatial maps visualizing these correlations.\nTo illustrate the family poverty over US, the average of family poverty variable, pr_f, will be computed over the available time period, and then, the poverty of families will be plotted using the county IDs. Moreover, to demonstrate the relation between family poverty and children expenses, the sum of children costs , mc_infant, mc_toddler, mc_preschool, mfcc_infant, mfcc_toddler, and mfcc_preschool, will be calculated and the correlation between sum_of_children_costs and families’ poverty will be computed and plotted.\n\n\n\nDiscussion\nThe proposed analysis plan is designed to dissect the intricate web of economic factors influencing family well-being and child-rearing costs. By delving into the spatial and statistical relationships between unemployment, poverty, and childcare expenses, we anticipate uncovering regional disparities and potential areas for policy intervention. The findings from this analysis could provide a robust evidence base for developing targeted strategies to alleviate the economic pressures on families, particularly in regions where the burden of childcare costs significantly intersects with high unemployment and poverty rates. Through this investigation, we aim to contribute to the broader dialogue on enhancing economic security and access to quality childcare, thereby supporting the well-being of families across the United States."

Is there a relationship between poverty and the cost of raising children?\n\nIntroduction\nThis section outlines our methodology for investigating the relationships between unemployment rates, poverty levels, and childcare costs across the United States. By examining these variables, we aim to identify patterns that could have significant implications for social policy and economic support systems.\n\n\nApproach\n\nThe emphasis will be on understanding the dynamics between family poverty rates and the financial burden of childcare. This part involves generating spatial maps to illustrate the average rate of family poverty across the US. Subsequently, we will assess the correlation between family poverty rates and the cumulative childcare costs (encompassing both Family Childcare and Center-based Care) for all age groups at the state level, with spatial maps visualizing these correlations.\nTo illustrate the family poverty over US, the average of family poverty variable, pr_f, will be computed over the available time period, and then, the poverty of families will be plotted using the state IDs. Moreover, to demonstrate the relation between family poverty and children expenses, the sum of children costs , mc_infant, mc_toddler, mc_preschool, mfcc_infant, mfcc_toddler, and mfcc_preschool, will be calculated and the correlation between sum_of_children_costs and families’ poverty will be computed and plotted.\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\n# Calculate average family poverty rate at county level\naverage_poverty_county &lt;- childcare_data %&gt;%\n  group_by(county_fips_code) %&gt;%\n  summarise(avg_pr_f = mean(pr_f, na.rm = TRUE)) %&gt;%\n  mutate(county_fips_code = as.character(county_fips_code))\n\n# Merge with US counties map\ncounties_map &lt;- get_urbn_map(\"counties\")\n\nmerged_data_county &lt;- left_join(counties_map, average_poverty_county, by = c(\"county_fips\" = \"county_fips_code\"))\n\n# Calculate average family poverty rate at state level\naverage_poverty_state &lt;- merged_data_county %&gt;%\n  group_by(state_name) %&gt;%\n  summarise(avg_pr_f_state = mean(avg_pr_f, na.rm = TRUE))\n\n\n\n\nold-style crs object detected; please recreate object with a recent sf::st_crs()"

    "text": "Discussion\nThe proposed analysis plan is designed to dissect the intricate web of economic factors influencing family well-being and child-rearing costs. By delving into the spatial and statistical relationships between unemployment, poverty, and childcare expenses, we anticipate uncovering regional disparities and potential areas for policy intervention. The findings from this analysis could provide a robust evidence base for developing targeted strategies to alleviate the economic pressures on families, particularly in regions where the burden of childcare costs significantly intersects with high unemployment and poverty rates. Through this investigation, we aim to contribute to the broader dialogue on enhancing economic security and access to quality childcare, thereby supporting the well-being of families across the United States."
