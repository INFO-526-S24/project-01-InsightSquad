The database offers childcare price data by childcare provider type, age of children, and county characteristics. Data are available from 2008 to 2018. It provide estimates of childcare prices at the county level by children’s age groups and care setting (home-based or center-based providers).\nThe dataset comprises various variables, making it suitable for diverse analyses. Although it lacks categorical variables, we can transform some of the variables into categorical format using bins. Moreover, this dataset offers valuable insights into poverty, race, population, and the unemployment rate across the US, enhancing our understanding of these issues.\nThe main variables that will be used and their description are provided in the following table.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable\nDescription\n\n\nunr_16\nUnemployment rate of the population aged 16 years old or older.\n\n\nfunr_16\nUnemployment rate of the female population aged 16 years old or older.\n\n\nmunr_16\nUnemployment rate of the male population aged 16 years old or older.\n\n\npr_f\nPoverty rate for families.\n\n\npr_p\nPoverty rate for individuals.\n\n\nmc_infant\nAggregated weekly, full-time median price charged for Center-based Care for infants (i.e. aged 0 through 23 months).\n\n\nmc_toddler\nAggregated weekly, full-time median price charged for Center-based Care for toddlers (i.e. aged 24 through 35 months).\n\n\nmc_preschool\nAggregated weekly, full-time median price charged for Center-based Care for preschoolers (i.e. aged 36 through 54 months).\n\n\nmfcc_infant\nAggregated weekly, full-time median price charged for Family Childcare for infants (i.e. aged 0 through 23 months).\n\n\nmfcc_toddler\nAggregated weekly, full-time median price charged for Family Childcare for toddlers (i.e. aged 24 through 35 months).\n\n\nmfcc_preschool\nAggregated weekly, full-time median price charged for Family Childcare for preschoolers (i.e. aged 36 through 54 months)."

Subsequently, for each county, we will calculate the correlation between the overall unemployment rate and individual poverty levels, and a spatial map of these correlations will be plotted.\nFor the second question, we will generate spatial maps showing the average family poverty across the US. Then, for each county, we will calculate the correlation between family poverty and the total costs for children of all ages (including Family Childcare and Center-based Care). A spatial map illustrating these correlations will be plotted."
