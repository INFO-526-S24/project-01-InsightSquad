Is there a relationship between poverty and the cost of raising children?"

Subsequently, for each county, we will calculate the correlation between the overall unemployment rate and individual poverty levels, and a spatial map of these correlations will be plotted.\nFor the second question, we will generate spatial maps showing the average family poverty across the US. Then, for each county, we will calculate the correlation between family poverty and the total costs for children of all ages including Family Childcare and Center-based Care. A spatial map illustrating these correlations will be plotted."
