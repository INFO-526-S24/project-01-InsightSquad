Which gender experiences higher unemployment rates in the US? Is there a relationship between the unemployment rate and poverty?\n\n\n## APPROACH\n::: nonincremental\n-Our analysis approach involves creating spatial maps to visualize mean unemployment rates across the US for both genders.\n-We also calculate the correlation between overall unemployment rates and individual poverty levels at the state level.\n-Spatial maps are chosen to provide a clear visual representation of regional disparities in unemployment rates and their relationship with poverty.\n:::\n\n## Plots of question 1\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](presentation_files/figure-revealjs/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png){width=1800}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Plot 2\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](presentation_files/figure-revealjs/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png){width=1800}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Plot 3\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](presentation_files/figure-revealjs/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png){width=1800}\n:::\n:::\n\n## Question 2\n\nWhich places have higher rates of family poverty? Is there a relationship between poverty and the cost of raising children?\n\n## Approach for question 2\n\n- Analyzing the link between family poverty rates and childcare costs.\n- Creating spatial maps to show average family poverty rates across the US.\n- Examining state-level correlations between poverty rates and childcare costs, visualized through spatial maps.\n\n## Plots of question 2\n\n::: columns\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Calculate average family poverty rate at county level\naverage_poverty_county <- childcare_data %>%\n  group_by(county_fips_code) %>%\n  summarise(avg_pr_f = mean(pr_f, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%\n  mutate(county_fips_code = as.character(county_fips_code))\n\n# Merge with US counties map\ncounties_map <- get_urbn_map(\"counties\")\n\nmerged_data_county <- left_join(counties_map, average_poverty_county, by = c(\"county_fips\" = \"county_fips_code\"))\n\n# Calculate average family poverty rate at state level\naverage_poverty_state <- merged_data_county %>%\n  group_by(state_name) %>%\n  summarise(avg_pr_f_state = mean(avg_pr_f, na.rm = TRUE))\n```\n:::\n\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](presentation_files/figure-revealjs/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png){width=1650}\n:::\n:::\n\n:::\n:::\n\n## Plot 2\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](presentation_files/figure-revealjs/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png){width=1800}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Plot 3\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](presentation_files/figure-revealjs/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png){width=1800}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Math Expressions {.smaller}\n\nYou can write LaTeX math expressions inside a pair of dollar signs, e.g.Â \\$\\\\alpha+\\\\beta\\$ renders $\\alpha + \\beta$. You can use the display style with double dollar signs:\n\n```         \n$$\\bar{X}=\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^nX_i$$\n```\n\n$$\n\\bar{X}=\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^nX_i\n$$\n\nLimitations:\n\n1.  The source code of a LaTeX math expression must be in one line, unless it is inside a pair of double dollar signs, in which case the starting `$$` must appear in the very beginning of a line, followed immediately by a non-space character, and the ending `$$` must be at the end of a line, led by a non-space character;\n\n2.  There should not be spaces after the opening `$` or before the closing `$`.\n\n# Wrap up\n\n## Feeling adventurous?\n\n-   You are welcomed to use the default styling of the slides. In fact, that's what I expect majority of you will do. You will differentiate yourself with the content of your presentation.\n\n-   But some of you might want to play around with slide styling. Some solutions for this can be found at https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs.\n",
