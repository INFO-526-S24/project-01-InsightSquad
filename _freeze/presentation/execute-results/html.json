Which gender experiences higher unemployment rates in the US? Is there a relationship between the unemployment rate and poverty?\n\n## APPROACH\n\n::: nonincremental\n-   Our analysis approach involves creating spatial maps to visualize mean unemployment rates across the US for both genders.\\\n-   We also calculate the correlation between overall unemployment rates and individual poverty levels at the state level.\\\n-   Spatial maps are chosen to provide a clear visual representation of regional disparities in unemployment rates and their relationship with poverty.\n:::\n\n## Average unemployment Rates in US\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](presentation_files/figure-revealjs/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png){width=1800}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Unemployment Rates by Gender\n\n::: columns\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n-   These plots show the distribution of unemployment rates by gender throughout the United States.\n\n-   High childcare costs can lead to increased unemployment rates\n\n-   It has been observed that women exhibit a higher employment rate.\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](presentation_files/figure-revealjs/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png){width=1800}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](presentation_files/figure-revealjs/unnamed-chunk-5-2.png){width=1800}\n:::\n:::\n\n:::\n:::\n\n## Scatter Plot\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](presentation_files/figure-revealjs/COR-1.png){width=1800}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Correlation Map\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](presentation_files/figure-revealjs/COR_SOATIAL-1.png){width=1800}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Question 2\n\nWhich places have higher rates of family poverty? Is there a relationship between poverty and the cost of raising children?\n\n## Approach for Question 2\n\n-   Analyzing the link between family poverty rates and childcare costs.\n-   Creating spatial maps to show average family poverty rates across the US.\n-   Examining state-level correlations between poverty rates and childcare costs.\n\n## Average family poverty rate at county level\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Calculate average family poverty rate at state level\naverage_poverty_state <- merged_data_county %>%\n  group_by(state_name) %>%\n  summarise(avg_pr_f_state = mean(avg_pr_f, na.rm = TRUE))\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](presentation_files/figure-revealjs/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png){width=1650}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Cumulative Childcare Costs by State\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](presentation_files/figure-revealjs/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png){width=1800}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Correlation Unemployment Rate and Childcare Costs\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](presentation_files/figure-revealjs/unnamed-chunk-12-1.png){width=1800}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## CONCLUSION\n\n::: incremental\n-   The Gender and Regional Unemployment Disparities highlighted notable differences in unemployment by gender and region, underscoring diverse economic challenges.\n\n-   Link Between Unemployment and Poverty showed a strong relationship between the rates, stressing the need for focused support.\n\n-   The Childcare Costs Affecting Family Poverty identified regions where high childcare costs contribute significantly to family poverty.\n:::\n\n## FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS\n\n::: incremental\n-   Temporal Analysis: Incorporating a temporal analysis by examining how the relationships between unemployment rates, poverty levels, and childcare costs evolve over time can provide insights into trends and potential long-term impacts.\n-   Interactive Data Visualization: Enhancing data visualization techniques by creating interactive dashboards which allow users to explore the data dynamically, customize views based on their interests, and gain deeper insights.\n-   Policy Impact Assessment: Examine the effectiveness of specific policies (like childcare subsidies or tax credits) on reducing unemployment and poverty, identifying successful strategies.\n-   Additional Socio-economic Variables: Incorporate variables such as education, healthcare access, and housing affordability to provide a comprehensive view of factors affecting family well-being.\n:::\n\n## Thank You\n\n![](images/Thank_img.webp){fig-align=\"center\"}\n",
