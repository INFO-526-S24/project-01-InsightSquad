Which gender experiences higher unemployment rates in the US? Is there a relationship between the unemployment rate and poverty?\n\n## APPROACH\n\n::: nonincremental\n- Our analysis approach involves creating spatial maps to visualize mean unemployment rates across the US for both genders.  \n- We also calculate the correlation between overall unemployment rates and individual poverty levels at the state level.  \n- Spatial maps are chosen to provide a clear visual representation of regional disparities in unemployment rates and their relationship with poverty.\n:::\n\n## Plots of Question 1\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](presentation_files/figure-revealjs/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png){width=1800}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Plot 2\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](presentation_files/figure-revealjs/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png){width=1800}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Plot 3\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](presentation_files/figure-revealjs/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png){width=1800}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Scatter Plot\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](presentation_files/figure-revealjs/COR-1.png){width=1800}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Correlation Map\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](presentation_files/figure-revealjs/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png){width=1800}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Question 2\n\nWhich places have higher rates of family poverty? Is there a relationship between poverty and the cost of raising children?\n\n## Approach for Question 2\n\n-   Analyzing the link between family poverty rates and childcare costs.\n-   Creating spatial maps to show average family poverty rates across the US.\n-   Examining state-level correlations between poverty rates and childcare costs, visualized through spatial maps.\n\n## Plots of Question 2\n\n::: columns\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Calculate average family poverty rate at county level\naverage_poverty_county <- childcare_data %>%\n  group_by(county_fips_code) %>%\n  summarise(avg_pr_f = mean(pr_f, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%\n  mutate(county_fips_code = as.character(county_fips_code))\n\n# Merge with US counties map\ncounties_map <- get_urbn_map(\"counties\")\n\nmerged_data_county <- left_join(counties_map, average_poverty_county, by = c(\"county_fips\" = \"county_fips_code\"))\n\n# Calculate average family poverty rate at state level\naverage_poverty_state <- merged_data_county %>%\n  group_by(state_name) %>%\n  summarise(avg_pr_f_state = mean(avg_pr_f, na.rm = TRUE))\n```\n:::\n\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](presentation_files/figure-revealjs/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png){width=1650}\n:::\n:::\n\n:::\n:::\n\n## Plot 2\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](presentation_files/figure-revealjs/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png){width=1800}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Plot 3\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](presentation_files/figure-revealjs/unnamed-chunk-12-1.png){width=1800}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## CONCLUSION\n\n:::incremental\n- Gender and Regional Unemployment Disparities: Highlighted notable differences in unemployment by gender and region, underscoring diverse economic challenges.\n- Link Between Unemployment and Poverty: Showed a strong relationship between unemployment and poverty, stressing the need for focused support\n- Childcare Costs Affecting Family Poverty: Identified regions where high childcare costs contribute significantly to family poverty.\n- Directions for Future Research and Policies: Suggested using predictive models and expanding research to better inform policies that support families.\n\n:::\n\n## FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS\n\n:::incremental\n- Time Series Analysis: Explore trends and changes in childcare costs, unemployment, and poverty over time to identify patterns or shifts due to economic cycles or policy changes.\n- Machine Learning Predictions: Use machine learning to predict future trends in unemployment, poverty levels, and childcare costs, aiding policymakers in decision-making.\n- Policy Impact Assessment: Examine the effectiveness of specific policies (like childcare subsidies or tax credits) on reducing unemployment and poverty, identifying successful strategies.\n- Additional Socio-economic Variables: Incorporate variables such as education, healthcare access, and housing affordability to provide a comprehensive view of factors affecting family well-being.\n\n:::\n\n## Feeling adventurous?\n\n-   You are welcomed to use the default styling of the slides. In fact, that's what I expect majority of you will do. You will differentiate yourself with the content of your presentation.\n\n-   But some of you might want to play around with slide styling.
