- Content: Is the research question well designed and is the data being used relevant to the research question?



- Content: Did the team use appropriate visualizations and did they interpret them accurately?



- Creativity and Critical Thought: Is the project carefully thought out? Are the limitations carefully considered? Does it appear that time and effort went into the planning and implementation of the project?



- Slides: Are the slides well organized, readable, not full of text, featuring figures with legible labels, legends, etc.?

Their slides are actually amazing. They start with a creative title, "From Mild to Wild" with a dark picture of the show in the background, aligning with the dark theme of the slides. The presentation is full of funny pictures and gifs, and their figures are solid. The transition between slides is also great. From start to end, there is not a single boring slide in their presentation. Well Done!

- Professionalism: How well did the team present? Does the presentation appear to be well practiced? Are they reading off of a script? Did everyone get a chance to say something meaningful about the project?
