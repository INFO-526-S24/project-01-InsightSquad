## INTRODUCTION
::: incremental
 -  The objective of this project is to investigate the complex dynamics between childcare costs, unemployment rates, and poverty levels across various locations in the United States.
-  Two main datasets are utilized: the National Database of Childcare Prices (NDCP) and a comprehensive -Counties Dataset.
-  The NDCP dataset spans from 2008 to 2018, providing childcare price data categorized by provider type, age of children, and county characteristics.
-  The Counties Dataset offers geographical and demographic insights, including unemployment rates, poverty rates, and median childcare costs for different age groups.
:::

## QUESTIONS PROPOSED
::: incremental
1. Which locations have lower unemployment rates? Which gender experiences higher unemployment rates in the US? Is there a relationship between the unemployment rate and poverty?

2. Which places have higher rates of family poverty? Is there a relationship between poverty and the cost of raising children?
:::

## APPROACH
::: nonincremental
-Our analysis approach involves creating spatial maps to visualize mean unemployment rates across the US for both genders.
-We also calculate the correlation between overall unemployment rates and individual poverty levels at the state level.
-Spatial maps are chosen to provide a clear visual representation of regional disparities in unemployment rates and their relationship with poverty.

## Layouts

You can use plain text

::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
-   or bullet points[^1]
:::

::: {.column width="60%"}
or in two columns

[^1]: And add footnotes

## Code

```{r, echo=FALSE}
model <- lm(mpg ~ speed, data = mtcars) 

model |> tidy()

model |> glance()

```

## Plots

```{r}
penguins |>
  mutate(species = ifelse(species == "Adelie", "Adelie", "Other")) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g, color = species)) +
  geom_point()
```

## Plot and text

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}

::: {.column width="50%"}
```{r, warning=FALSE, fig.width=5.5}
penguins |>
  ggplot(aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = species, color = species)) +
  geom_boxplot(linewidth = 0.75,
               outlier.size = 2.5) +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 15) +
  theme(legend.key.size = unit(0.8, "cm"))

## Tables

If you want to generate a table, make sure it is in the HTML format (instead of Markdown or other formats), e.g.,

```{r}
penguins |> 
  head() |>
  kableExtra::kable() |>
  kableExtra::kable_styling()
```

## Math Expressions {.smaller}

You can write LaTeX math expressions inside a pair of dollar signs, e.g.Â \$\\alpha+\\beta\$ renders $\alpha + \beta$. You can use the display style with double dollar signs:

```         
$$\bar{X}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^nX_i$$
```

$$
\bar{X}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^nX_i
$$

Limitations:

1.  The source code of a LaTeX math expression must be in one line, unless it is inside a pair of double dollar signs, in which case the starting `$$` must appear in the very beginning of a line, followed immediately by a non-space character, and the ending `$$` must be at the end of a line, led by a non-space character;

2.  There should not be spaces after the opening `$` or before the closing `$`.

# Wrap up

## Feeling adventurous?

-   You are welcomed to use the default styling of the slides. In fact, that's what I expect majority of you will do. You will differentiate yourself with the content of your presentation.

-   But some of you might want to play around with slide styling. Some solutions for this can be found at https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs.
